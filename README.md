## Thank you for taking a look at my profile ✌️

I'm a computer system engineer with many years of experience. I am a very curious person with a desired of automate as much as possible while also following the KISS rule.

In my career path I've held different job roles, which helped me to develop myself in various areas. They all gave me a different point of view, helping me see things from different perspectives. I'm saying that because my career path has been as follows:


QC > NOC > TechOps > QA > DevOps

- QC: Quality Control
- NOC: Network Operation Center
- TechOps: Technical Operations
- DevOps: Development Operations

I consider myself a techie guy, with a passion for knowledge and always aiming to improve. 

I have a homelab that consists of only one computer (to keep costs and heat low) where I experiment with different VMs, like my kubernetes cluster on TalOS VMs, along with a few other ones (this is basically my playground). 

Linux and AWS are basically the core of my arsenal but of course I've been exposed to a lot of different tools over the years.

If you want to get in touch with me, feel free to send me a message on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyestrada) profile.
